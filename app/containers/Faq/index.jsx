              Do your animals receive vaccinations, antibiotics, or hormones?
            </b>
          </p>

          <p className="my-3">
            Our meats are natural and have no hormones, GMOs, or MSG. We do,
            however, use meat preservatives for shipping. This includes salt
            since our meats are marinated, seasoned, and cooked before they’re
            shipped.

          <p className="my-3">
            <b>Where does your meat come from?</b>
          </p>

          <p className="my-3">
            All of our meat is locally sourced from ranches across the
            Intermountain West (ID, WY, UT). We use as much Utah meat as is
            available to us. However, there is not always a continuous supply of
            local meats to meet our demands. Additionally, sourcing beef and
            chicken has been a challenge since COVID, so adjustments must be
            made. However, it is 100% natural grass-fed and grass-finished meat.
          </p>

          <p className="my-3">
            <b>Are all of your animals grass-fed?</b>
          </p>
          <p className="my-3">
            All our beef is grass fed/finished, while our pork and chicken are
            free range and pasture raised. Everything we sell is sourced from
            local farms here in the Intermountain West.

            Some U.S. dairy farms inject the genetically engineered hormone
            rBGH. We do not add hormones nor do we have any dairy cows.

            <b>Is Just Meats lab grown?</b>
          </p>
          <p className="my-3">
            No, our meat comes from real livestock sourced from ranches in
            Wyoming, Idaho and Utah.
          </p>

          <p className="my-3">

          <p className="my-3">
            Yes, our beef is grass fed/finished and our chicken is free range.
            All the animals are pasture-raised.
          </p>

          <p className="my-3">
            <b>Is your meat GMO fed or given non-organic food? </b>
          </p>
          <p className="my-3">
            Absolutely not. We follow USDA guidelines with regards to feed.
            However, all our meat is grass-fed and grass-finished.

          <p className="my-3">
            We source Choice on beef, which also represents the macros in
            Recipal — a software much like the MyFitnessPal app.

          <p className="my-3">
            We use all gluten-free sauces and our meats are gluten-free, too. We

            ever changes. While our products are gluten-free, they are not
            celiac-safe, as there is a possibility of contamination in our

          </p>
          <p className="my-3">
            Just Meats creates authentic restaurant-grade meats. We use the best
            ingredients and cooking technology to provide the same experience of
            a restaurant. Soy sauce is a key ingredient in Teriyaki sauce, Sweet
            & Spicy, and our Braised Beef sauce. We have tried different
            ingredients to imitate soy, but it just doesn’t taste the same. We
            did, however, make the distinction of being gluten free.

            <b>Are your meats Keto friendly?</b>
          </p>
          <p className="my-3">
            Outside of our pork, our meats don’t have a high enough amount of
            fat to be keto friendly. However, all of our meats are high protein
            and low carb. Please refer to the nutrition labels on our website to
            make sure that our meats accommodate your diet.

            <b>What allergens are in your products? </b>
          </p>
          <p className="my-3">
            All our meats and sauce are gluten-free. The meat and sauce packets
            do contain gluten free soy sauce, which is mentioned in the
            ingredients. We don’t currently use peanuts, but we have in the past
            and may use them in the future.

            <b>Why does my label list so much salt? </b>

            It’s a typo. All of our meats contain between 100-500 mg of sodium.

            future.

          <p className="my-3">
            Renderings are the by-products of our meat. The French call it au
            Jus, others refer to it as drippings. Ultimately, it’s the liquid
            that renders in the cooking process. We remove most of the fat and
            what’s left is beef, chicken, or pork stock.

          </p>
          <p className="my-3">
            All products that are packaged with a listed weight can have a 80%

            compliant with the FDA. Our packaging is compliant with the FDA.

            </b>
          </p>
          <p className="my-3">
            There are 16 oz of cooked protein in each container, along with 2 oz
            of sauces or marinades. When meat is cooked, there is a loss of
            weight. For example, our brisket has a 50% yield loss in cooking.
            That would represent an 8 oz raw or 4 oz cooked piece of meat.

          <p className="my-3">
            <b>How am I supposed to open the vacuum seal? </b>
          </p>
          <p className="my-3">
            The vacuum sealing is strong to prevent the meat from spoiling
            during transit. We recommend using a knife to cut alongside the edge
            of the container instead of trying to peel the vacuum sealing off.

            <b>Can the meat be microwaved? </b>
          </p>
          <p className="my-3">
            We do not recommend microwaving our meat, but if it’s the only
            option, using a microwave is just fine. We do, however, recommend
            adding a little extra sauce to add more moisture when you microwave
            the meat.

            <b>Best by dates? </b>
          </p>
          <p className="my-3">
            Unopened meat will last 10-14 days in the fridge and 4-6 months in
            the freezer. Once the seal is opened, the meat should be consumed in
            3-5 days.

            <b>Is the food delivered frozen? </b>
          </p>
          <p className="my-3">
            The meats are vacuum sealed and frozen when we ship them out. Since
            UPS has 1-2 days to deliver the meats to you after we ship, the
            meats may be chilled when they arrive. Be sure to refrigerate or
            freeze your meat once it arrives.
