              Please make sure you are subscribed to Just Meats before you
              purchase. If you want a single order, we recommend double checking
              to see if it is a “ONE-TIME order” or a “SUBSCRIPTION order”
              before purchasing.

              <strong>1. Shipping Issues:</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              If you experience shipping issues or delays, please contact our
              customer support team at support@justmeats.com or by calling
              888-343-1242 and we will find the best solution we can. Depending
              on the issue, this will either include issuing a credit to your
              account or rescheduling your shipping date. Once your shipment is
              with UPS, it will display as in-transit on your tracking number
              and your order will be shipped in 1–2 days. If you have yet to
              receive a tracking number, it will display as label created,
              unfulfilled, or partially fulfilled. This means your order is
              still being processed and/or getting ready to ship.

              Your meat should not be delivered hot or melted (see our warm meat
              section). Due to the perishable nature of our product, we are
              unable to accept returns. If the delivery failed, please call us
              and we can discuss sending you a new order or issuing in-store
              credit.

            </p>
            <p>
              Please double check your address to see if it is correct before
              confirming your order. This includes adding your apartment, lot,
              or unit number. If you&apos;ve entered the wrong shipping address,
              please contact us as soon as possible because once the shipment
              process has begun, it will be too late. We will make every effort
              to correct the address before the order is shipped. If the order
              has
              <br />
              <br />
              already been fulfilled or shipped to the incorrect address, we

            <p>
              If your order is delayed due to unforeseen circumstances, weather,
              or holidays please contact our customer support team. Your options
              may include rescheduling your delivery or providing credit for an
              upcoming order.

              The estimated time to receive your order is around 1-2 weeks from
              the day you place your order, depending on the volume. There are
              times your order may come earlier than one week, but the standard
              is a 1–2-week window.

            <p>
              If you receive a significant upfront discount, smaller ongoing
              discounts, and additional subscriber-only meat options, you are on
              a subscription. You can cancel your subscription on justmeats.com
              via your subscription account.
              <br />
              <br />
              A cancellation request must be completed 24 hours prior (MST) to
              the renewal date and the order being charged. We cannot refund
              your order once the process has begun.
              <br />
              To cancel your subscription, please log into your account and
              navigate to ‘manage your subscription. From there, click ‘edit
              selection’ and then ‘cancel’ (found at the bottom of that page).

              You can also call 888-343-1242 to request skipping and holding for

              In the event you receive meat products that are not at the
              appropriate temperature upon delivery, please contact us
              IMMEDIATELY, so we can determine the appropriate action.
              <br />

              *To make this decision, we require pictures and a small 30-60
              second video displaying the contents in the box. This includes the
              box, the warm meat(s), and melted ice packs on arrival. Once your
              pictures and video have been sent to our support team, we can work

              There may be moments when the inventory on our meats at a specific

              distribution centers will replace the low inventory meat for a

              Porch pirates are a real concern. If you have experienced this
              issue with other deliveries, we recommend signing up for UPS My
              Choice to get up-to-the-minute notifications on the status of your
              order. You can also include delivery instructions and photos to a
              safer and more secure location as well. A porch camera is another
              good idea we recommend. If your order is lost or stolen, please
              call our customer experience team at 888-343-1242.

              We reserve the right to modify this cancellation policy at any

              account will be renewed in the next 15 or 30 days, at least 3 days
